    <p style="display:inline; font-size:30px;">Although the Insect Division has something on the order of 4.5 million specimens in all of our collections, we have only a small part catalogued in databases. Our collection objects are catalogued in Specify, which is used by all of the biological museums at the University of Michigan. As of the summer of 2019, approximately 10% of our holdings are catalogued.  All of the North American Odonata specimens are catalogued, some of the Lepidoptera, about half of the Orthoptera, most of our aquatic orders, and small parts of the rest of the collection.  Additional digitization efforts in TCN participation and ad-hoc cataloguing are underway. Most of our field notes and related materials have been digitized and will soon be available on the web.</p>

    <br><br><br><br> <p style="display:inline ; font-size: 30px;">The Michigan Odonata Survey has databased all of the Michigan Odonata in the UMMZ, as well as parts of the Michigan State University collection as well as some other small collections. At over 29,000 records, it is one of the largest specimen-level Odonata databases available on the web.  All records are geo-referenced.</p>
<p style="display:inline ; font-size: 30px;">The Museum of Zoology has maintained collections for over 100 years, and the earliest of our collections in the Insect Division that are documented with field notes is the 1908 expedition to Huron County, Michigan. Subsequent UMMZ curators and staff kept notes of their field activities, with the activities of Theodore H. Hubbell comprising a majority of the records. At minimum, the field notes represent a listing of places visited where specimens were obtained. Those records often have additional information that is not contained on a specimen label, and a well-documented expedition often has information on vegetation, land features, weather, associated species, and may also contain photographs and maps of the collecting events.</p>
