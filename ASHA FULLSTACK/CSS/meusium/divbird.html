    <img src="https://www.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/districts/pathanamthitta/images/2019/10/23/pathanamthitta-birds.jpg.transform/onm-articleimageamp/image.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" style="float:left; border:7px groove green;">
<p style="display:inline; font-size:30px;;">The Bird Division houses extensive research and teaching collections comprising nearly 215,000 specimens that serve as a global resource for the study of birds. These collections are cosmopolitan in scope with regional strengths from the Indian subcontinent, Neotropics, and North America. Faculty and student research within the UMMZ Bird Division centers on using genomics, morphology, ecology, and behavior to examine the origin and evolution of avian diversity.All modern birds lie within the crown group Aves (alternately Neornithes), which has two subdivisions: the Palaeognathae, which includes the flightless ratites (such as the ostriches) and the weak-flying tinamous, and the extremely diverse Neognathae, containing all other birds.[44] These two subdivisions have variously been given the rank of superorder,[45] cohort,[9] or infraclass.[46] Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800[47] to 10,758.[48]

    The discovery of Vegavis from the Maastrichtian, the last stage of the Late Cretaceous proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic era.[49] The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago,[50] are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification. In 2020, Asteriornis from the Maastrichtian was described, it appears to be a close relative of Galloanserae, the earliest diverging lineage within Neognathae.[1]

<br><br><br><br><br><br><p style="display:inline ;font-size:30px;">Most studies agree on a Cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the Early Cretaceous[3][51] to the latest Late Cretaceous.[52][4] Similarly, there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred before or after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[53] This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous evolutionary radiation, while fossil evidence points to a Cenozoic radiation (the so-called 'rocks' versus 'clocks' controversy). Previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial,[53][54] but more recent estimates, using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of calibrating molecular clocks, showed that while according to some studies, modern birds originated early in the Late Cretaceous in Western Gondwana, a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event. Modern birds expanded from West Gondwana to the Laurasia through two routes. One route was an Antarctic interchange in the Paleogene. This can be confirmed with the presence of multiple avian groups in Australia and New Zealand. The other route was probably through North America, via land bridges, during the Paleocene. This allowed the expansion and diversification of Neornithes into the Holarctic and Paleotropics.[55] On the other hand, the occurrence of Asteriornis in the Northern Hemisphere challenges biogeographical hypotheses of a Gondwanan origin of crown birds.[1]
