    <p id="b" style="display:inline ;">The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ) Micro(µ)CT Scanning Laboratory can allow researchers to generate high resolution tomographic data of bone, fossils, and contrast enhanced tissues. These data can include 3D surface visualizations of anatomy and morphology, that can facilitate morphometric studies, phylogenetics analysis, and biomechanics modelling. 

        The UMMZ µCT Scanning Laboratory owns and operates a Nikon XT H 225ST µCT Scanner. The specifications are found below. The UMMZ µCT Scanning Laboratory operates under all LARA, MIOSHA, and OSEH safety guidelines. All scanning is conducted or supervised by the Lab Manager. Specimen access should be arranged by the user ahead of time with the appropriate UMMZ collections manager.Users who wish to schedule time on the UMMZ µCT Scanning Laboratory should contact the Lab Manager. Most scanning will be scheduled during regular business hours (Monday to Friday, 8am-5pm). The UMMZ µCT Scanning Laboratory currently is funded by the oVert TCN project and UMMZ faculty-curators, and is not available for external use. </p>
